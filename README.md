## The idea

This project was a quick idea to provide the photo advent calendar we create for our families each year for the family living in New Zealand. Each year two versions are send out to two very happy aunts with their partners.

The first throw of this project was created in kind of a hurry two years ago so the architecture might not be perfect.
